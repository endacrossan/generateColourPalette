# generateColourPalette

Random color generator using the HSL colour model

Reloading the page generates a new Hue value between 0 and 360 and creates different colour variants by adjusting the Lightness between 3 and 97% (50% is the base colour selection).

The Saturation can be adjusted between 20 and 100% using the slider on the page.
